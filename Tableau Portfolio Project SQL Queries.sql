COVID-19 Tableau Analysis – Decision-Oriented SQL Queries

Purpose:
These queries were designed to support high-level public health analysis
and country-level deep dives for visualization in Tableau.

Focus areas:
- Global severity and mortality
- Country-level impact (India)
- Vaccination rollout and its association with death rates
